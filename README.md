# (WIP) Kristina Kemmer's Management/Leadership ReadMe

## What is this?
This is a quick way to
     Introduce me as a human
     Answer some likely questions
     Set expectations about what you can depend on from me as your coworker and manager

Also, this will always be a work in progress.

Lastly, this is inspired by Aaron Lerch, Roy Rappaport, Jackson Dowell, Katie Womersley, John Cline, Lara Hogan, and many other great leaders that have found the importance of transparency, honesty, and bringing your whole self to your job.

## About Me (Personality, Quirks, Life outside of work)
* I live in Denver, CO (well, Arvada really) with my wife and 3 daughters. Right now they are 3, 2, and 1, so our house is best described as a circus (in the best way). If you are on a call with me, chances are good you may hear screaming (of joy or otherwise) in the background.
* I love to read (fiction, historical fiction, dystopia), but I've never been keen on reading nonfiction (I :heart: my Audible account for that).
* I love live music, so Denver is a pretty good place to be - especially since [Red Rocks](https://www.redrocksonline.com/concerts-events) is about 15 minutes from my house.
* I am a runner, but I'm not necessarily competitive. It gives me a chance to clear my head, think through problems, and catch up on my "reading". I'm currently training for the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington D.C. this October.
* I am an introvert, but I hide it well. Many people that work with me don't realize it. Days of back to back meetings drain many people, but I also become less patient and more direct than I'd like to be.
* I have a belief that communication can be the savior or downfall of any project, relationship, or organization. I try very hard to listen first, ask many questions, and provide my input to further the discussion or decision.

## My Job
I am primarily here to do three things:
1. Provide context (of all kinds, business, technical, strategic, relationship, organizational).
2. Engage, retain, and grow world-class talent.
3. Get out of the way.

If I do something that negatively impacts my ability to **retain** you, please tell me as soon as possible.

If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job than **setting context**, please tell me as soon as possible.


## My Modus Operandi

**1:1s.** I'll schedule 45 minutes to an hour every other week so we have dedicated time to talk. 1:1 meetings are incredibly important to me (and hopefully to you); I will try my best not to reschedule them, and I will set them up so that you can move them if you have a conflict or need to reschedule. Besides the cadence, here is what I consider a 1:1 for:

* Dedicated space for us to talk about anything and everything YOU want.
* They are primarily for you, and only secondarily for me.
* Itâ€™s not a status meeting, unless you want to talk about status
* NOT for urgent matters; PLEASE touch base with me on anything urgent as soon as it makes sense. Of course, we can always follow up and talk about the topic in our 1:1.


## Failure Modes
