# (WIP) Kristina Kemmer's Management/Leadership ReadMe

## What is this?
This is a quick way to
* introduce me as a human
* answer some likely questions
* set expectations about what you can depend on from me as your coworker and manager
     
Also, this will always be a work in progress.

Lastly, this is inspired by Aaron Lerch, Roy Rappaport, Jackson Dowell, Katie Womersley, John Cline, Lara Hogan, and many other great leaders that have found the importance of transparency, honesty, and bringing your whole self to your job. :computer:

## About Me (personality, quirks, life outside of work)
* I live in Denver, CO (well, Arvada really) with my wife and 3 daughters. As of the last update they are 4, 3, and 2. We also have 2 large dogs, so our house is best described as a circus (and quite loud). If you are on a call with me, there is a chance you may hear screaming (of joy or otherwise) in the background.
* I love to read (fiction, historical fiction, dystopia), but I've never been keen on reading nonfiction (I :heart: my Audible account for that).
* I love live music, so the Denver area is a pretty good place to be - especially since [Red Rocks](https://www.redrocksonline.com/concerts-events) is about 15 minutes from my house.
* I am a runner, but I'm not necessarily competitive. It gives me a chance to clear my head, think through problems, and catch up on my "reading." My last race was the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington D.C. last October.
* I am an introvert, but I hide it well. Many people that work with me don't realize it. Days of back to back meetings drain most folks, but I particularly become less patient and more direct than I'd like to be.
* I have a belief that communication can be the savior or downfall of any project, relationship, or organization. I try very hard to listen first, ask many questions, and provide my input to further the discussion or decision.

## My Job
I am primarily here to do the following:
1. Provide context (of all kinds, business, technical, strategic, relationship, organizational).
2. Engage, retain, and grow world-class talent.
3. Work with my partners in Product and Design to set high-level vision and strategy for the products in our area.
4. Get out of the way.

If I do something that negatively impacts my ability to **retain** you, please tell me as soon as possible.

If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job than **setting context**, please tell me as soon as possible.

### My Goal(s)
* You feel empowered as a leader to figure out what you need to do, how it should be done,  and then to do it.
* You have enough context to understand your priority and focus over (at least) the next quarter. 
* You have built effective relationships with others in the company.
* We have a clear roadmap and understanding of where we are going.

## My Modus Operandi
**1:1s.** I'll schedule 30-45 minutes every week with folks on my team, so we have dedicated time to talk. These meetings are incredibly important to me (and hopefully to you); I will try my best not to reschedule them, and I will set them up so that you can move them if you have a conflict or need to reschedule. Besides the cadence, here is what I consider a 1:1 for:

* a dedicated space for us to talk about anything and everything YOU want.
* they are primarily for you, and only secondarily for me.
* it is NOT a status meeting unless you really want to talk about status.
* it is NOT for urgent matters; PLEASE touch base with me on anything urgent as soon as it makes sense. Of course, we can always follow up and talk about the topic in our 1:1.

**Communication.** There is nothing better than face-to-face, in-person communication. I understand the irony here since I've been working in exclusively remote teams for the last 2 years; it means any possible "in real life" time we can get is important. The next best option is face-to-face video. If it feels like we’re having trouble communicating, I will invariably err on the side of, “let’s jump on a video call."
* I respond to emails within 24 hours, and ideally within four hours.
* I try to be as responsive as possible via Slack; this can be hard in back-to-back meeting days, but I will respond by the end of the day at the very latest. 
* It is helpful to understand from you how urgently you need a response from me.

**Feedback.** Candid, compassionate, and timely feedback is crucial to a high-functioning team. I strive to provide feedback in as real-time as possible, and I ask that you do the same for me!

**Performance.** I follow a Green / Yellow / Red performance assessment and communication model. My goal is for you always to know where you stand. If you ever feel you don’t know, please ask me.
* **Green** - there may be things to improve, but those are for your continued growth. If nothing ever changed, we're good here.
* **Yellow** - there are one or more behaviors that, if left unchanged, will not be sustainable. Something needs to change, and we'll talk about these concerns with regularity in our 1:1s.
* **Red** - there is a significant problem, with a timebox for change, and possible outcomes. We have explicitly talked about the issue, the timeline, and what those possible outcomes are. We'll talk about this with regularity in our 1:1s.

*A note* - Being **Yellow** or **Red** may be stressful, but it should not be terrifying because it is absolutely recoverable! Working back to **Green** builds trust and proves that you accept feedback, acknowledge your role in the situation, and are willing and capable of changing, growing, and improving. That is incredible.

**Transparency.** I bias toward transparency and honesty. You can ask me anything - please do! I would rather know the question is out there than have folks make (possibly inaccurate) assumptions.  I will always provide as much information as I'm able, or I will tell you why I can't.
